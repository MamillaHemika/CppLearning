- vector&lt;A&gt; v;  creates an empty vector of type A.
- v.reserve(5);  allocates memory for at least 5 elements but does not change the size of the vector.

**Reserve: v.reserve(5);**

The reserve function is a member function of the std::vector class. Here's what it does:

1. **Purpose**:
    - The reserve function is used to allocate enough memory for the vector to hold at least the specified number of elements. When you call v.reserve(5);, you are telling the vector to allocate memory to hold **at least** 5 elements.
2. **Capacity vs. Size**:
    - **Size**: This is the number of actual elements contained in the vector (which starts at 0 when the vector is empty).
    - **Capacity**: This is the amount of memory allocated for the vector, meaning how many elements it can hold before it needs to allocate more memory (i.e., before it needs to grow).
    - Before any elements are added to the vector, the capacity is initially 0, and it can grow as elements are added. By calling reserve, you change the capacity to be at least the requested number (in this case, 5), but the size remains 0 since no elements have been added yet.
3. **Efficiency**:
    - Reserving memory in advance can improve performance when you know in advance how many elements you need to add to the vector. This avoids multiple memory allocations and copying of elements that would happen if you were to add elements one by one without reserving.
    - If you add elements to the vector after reserving, it will not need to resize (reallocate and copy existing elements to new memory) until the number of elements exceeds the reserved capacity.
4. **Usage**:
    - After calling reserve(5);, you can push back elements into the vector. The vector will now have enough capacity to accommodate at least 5 elements without needing to reallocate:
    - v.push_back(element1); // Now size = 1
    - v.push_back(element2); // Now size = 2
    - // ...
5. **No Change in Size**:
    - Importantly, calling reserve does not change the size of the vector; it only affects the capacity. After calling reserve(5);, v.size() would still return 0 until elements are added.

**Summary**

- vector&lt;A&gt; v; creates an empty vector of type A.
- v.reserve(5); allocates memory for at least 5 elements but does not change the size of the vector.
- It's a proactive way to manage dynamic memory and can lead to better performance when dealing with a known amount of data.
