Example:

int hashFunction(int key) {

return key % tableSize; // Simple hash function

}

The function you provided is a very basic example of a hash function, which is used to map an input (in this case, an integer key) to a specific index (or bucket) of a hash table. Let's break it down step by step.

**Components of the Hash Function**

1. **Input**:
    - The input to this function is an integer called key. This could be any integer value you want to store in the hash table (for example, an ID, a number, etc.).
2. **Output**:
    - The output is the index or position in the hash table where the key will be stored.
3. **Table Size**:
    - tableSize refers to the total number of buckets (or slots) available in the hash table. This is typically a prime number or a power of 2 to reduce collisions but is just an integer indicating how many unique slots you have.

**How the Function Works**

The hash function computes the index by using the modulo operation:

return key % tableSize;

- The modulo operation (%) gives the remainder of the integer division of key by tableSize.
- This ensures that the resulting index is always within the bounds of the hash table indices, which range from 0 to tableSize - 1.

**Example**

Let's say you have a hash table with tableSize = 10. This means your hash table has 10 buckets, indexed from 0 to 9.

**Example Keys**

- **Key = 15**
- index = 15 % 10
- \= 5
- **Key = 28**
- index = 28 % 10
- \= 8
- **Key = 7**
- index = 7 % 10
- \= 7
- **Key = 22**
- index = 22 % 10
- \= 2

**Hash Table Storage**

Now let's see how the keys would be stored in the hash table:

| **Bucket Index** | **Elements** |
| --- | --- |
| 0   |     |
| 1   |     |
| 2   | 22  |
| 3   |     |
| 4   |     |
| 5   | 15  |
| 6   |     |
| 7   | 7   |
| 8   | 28  |
| 9   |     |

In this example:

- The key 15 is hashed to index 5.
- The key 28 is hashed to index 8.
- The key 7 is hashed to index 7.
- The key 22 is hashed to index 2.

**Benefits of a Hash Function**

- **Uniform Distribution**: A good hash function distributes keys uniformly across the available buckets, minimizing the number of collisions, where two or more keys hash to the same index.
- **Efficiency**: Ideally, accesses to the hash table (insertions, deletions, and lookups) can be done in constant time, ( O(1) ), when collision handling methods are effective.

**Considerations**

1. **Collisions**: The simple hash function used here can lead to collisions (more than one key hashing to the same index). Strategies like chaining (using lists at each index) or open addressing are used to resolve collisions.
2. **Quality of Hash Function**: The choice of the hash function affects the efficiency of the hash table. A more complex hash function might be required in practical implementations to further reduce collisions.

**Summary**

In summary, the provided hash function simply maps a key to an index in a hash table by taking the modulo of the key with the table size. This ensures the output index falls within the valid range and helps organize the storage of the keys in a way that allows for quick access and management.
